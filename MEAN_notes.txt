Many functions have 'Sync' appended to the name:
fs.readFile(...) vs. fs.readFileSync(...)
asynchronous     vs.  synchronous
Asynchrouous calls aren't wrapped with try..catch, error is passed back to callback function to be handled.

Synchronous calls need try...catch [used with functions like JSON.parse()]



CH5
---
Reading arguments from command line, via process.argv array
first 2 arguments are executable followed by the name of the invoked JS file
actual application arguments begin at process.argv[2]

fileRead() - returns a Buffer object
you can either use .toString() to convert to string
or specify 'utf8' (or other encoding) to return readable data

writeFile() - defaults to utf8 encoding
wx flag causes error if file already exists
a flag causes data to append to file  (doesn't add new line)

HTTP server
-----------
'createServer()' executed callback for each request from the client
'req' argument contains info about the client and requestd resource
'res' argument contains info and methods regarding the response.

'writeHead()' method writes status code and options to the headers.
'res.end()' MANDATORY call that is required to complete the connection
'res.end()' supports taking the same arguments as 'res.write()'
This means the entire response can be written via the 'res.end()'

Routes
------
perform different actions based on the request method and URL
combo of HTTP verb and requested URL is known as a route


CH6
---
common practice to execute the callback function on error and 'bubble the error back up to the calling function

In Node, the common callback convention is that the first argument to a callback function should be the error object, or null if there were no errors.

Express framework!
  1. the router
  2. routes
  3. middleware

*Router - robust request routing.
app.get('/employees/:id', function(req, res, next){...});
Route Lookup - order in which routes are added to the router is very important
Static Files - express.static(directory);

*Middleware - function(req, res, next)
req: incoming request object (http.ClientRequest)
res: response object (http.ServerResponse)
next: callback function [can NOT pass data to next]

*Routes - HTTP verb and a path
HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
GET: get data from a web server
POST: send data to a web server
DELETE: delete information from a web server
PUT: update existing data on a web server

URI: Uniform Resource Identifier

Optional Parameters
? makes a parameter optional
/teams/:teamName/employees/:employeeId?

multiple optional parameters:
/teams/:teamName?/employees/:employeeId?
(not recommended hard to document and debug)

Starting the Server (not node app.js) run node bin/www
or run npm start (added to package.json scripts)
[NOTE: must do a 'sudo npm install' after running 'express' to install all dependencies!]
www script is entry point for server, calls in app.js
app.js still houses majority of the server logic

Middleware example demo:
function retrieveEmployee (req, res, next) {
  Employee.findOne({
    _id: req.params.employeeId
  }).exec(function (error, employee) {
    if (error) {
      return next(error);
    }
    res.locals.employee = employee;
    return next();
  });
}
